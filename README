This Git repository includes all of the source code used in creating a metagrid (MVC approach) within EXTJS 4.

You need to run from the EXTJS4 examples/app directory.

This example is my first attempt at MVC in EXTJS4 so please understand there will be room for a lot of improvement.

I have also included a re-factor of a notification UX as the original would not run in EXTJS4.
